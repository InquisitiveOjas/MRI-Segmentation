# MRI-Segmentation
We, the AI development team of Drishti - A Revolutionary Concept, NIT SURAT has succesfully complemented this project on MRI Segmentation.  

Alzheimer's dataset has been utilized to learn MRI Segmentation. 

There are 4 classes in the dataset: Mild Demeted, Moderated Demeted, Non Demeted and Very Mild Demeted.

Best performance was obtained by utilizing ResNet34 over the PyTorch framework.
